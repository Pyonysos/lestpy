# lestpy

## Overview
### Why
Lestpy is aimed to model regression problems with a bunch of logical interactions. This approach is an alternative way to describe the relationship between the features and the targets.

### List of modules
* lbm_model
* visualize
* outlier

## Getting Started
### Installation

You can install LestPy from [PyPI]():

```sh
    python -m pip install lestpy
```

### How to

## Use
Lestpy is designed to be used similarly to sklearn modelization classes and their methods (fit(), transform(), predict(), ...)
